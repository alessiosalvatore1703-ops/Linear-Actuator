## Linear Magnetic-Actuated Conveyor System
# Project Description
This project describes the study, design, and control of a novel linear magnetic-actuated conveyor system for assembly line applications. The system was developed at JOiiNT LAB in collaboration with industrial partners operating in the field of automated production systems.
The proposed solution introduces an intelligent and modular transport system based on Linear Electric Machines (LEMs), with particular emphasis on Linear Synchronous Motors (LSMs). The objective is to overcome the main limitations of traditional belt-based conveyor systems, including mechanical complexity, limited configurability, and poor adaptability to dynamic production requirements.
