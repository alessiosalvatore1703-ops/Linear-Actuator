This work describes the study, design, and control of a novel linear magnetic-actuated
conveyor system for assembly lines, developed at JOiiNT LAB in collaboration with
industrial partners operating in the field of automated production systems. The project
proposes an intelligent, modular transport solution based on linear electric machines
(LEMs), particularly linear synchronous motors (LSMs), aiming to overcome limitations
of traditional belt conveyors—namely, mechanical complexity, limited configurability,
and poor adaptability to dynamic production needs.
